This repository is dedicated to archiving our code, and 10478Cs code, for the Tower Takeover VEX competition, and to help provide a
resource for other teams at GCA to learn from.

All learning resources will be in the Red5Documentation folder, detailing how we made our alliance program on the red side for 5 points,
good coding practices, limitations and our line of thinking at the time.

Not all projects are up to date, in particular the skills code is outdated and doesnt function nearly as well as we needed.

There will also be a few documents describing a few concepts such as PID, and using voltage over velocity control.
